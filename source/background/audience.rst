Audience
========

Not all Internet services are equally critical. This guide is aimed for teams who themselves are developing services dealing with private and financial data, though it can be used as a reference for other kind of services. The guide is not geared towards your average company business card website, software product deployments or generic IT administration.

The audience of the guide includes, but is not limited, to

* Website developers

* System administrators and infrastructure operators

* Technology and security officers

* ...and everybody who is responsible for making sure they do not get hacked

The guide assumes the reader has the basic understanding how Internet services are developed and operated. The developers and system administrators can use the guide as a reference when building and :doc:`assessing security of their organizations <../assessment/index>`. Furthermore, with the :doc:`evaluation points <../background/index>` provided by the guide a third party can audit an organization and provide a public track record of the matter.
