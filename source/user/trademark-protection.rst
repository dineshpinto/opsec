Trademark protection
==============================================================

**Is the name of the service trademarked??** 

A trademark helps protect against advertisement phishing.

If you type the service name into Google or a web browser address search bar, Google displays advertisements on the top of the actual search results. These advertisement can be bought out to create misleading phishing links, like *www.blockchain.com.de/wallet/login*. Normal end users cannot distinguish between phishing advertisements and actual search results.

If you have properly trademarked your service name, you can ask Google AdWords to not allow it to be used in advertisements, making advertisement phishing harder.

Google AdWords is known to take down phishing advertisements quite slowly when reported.
