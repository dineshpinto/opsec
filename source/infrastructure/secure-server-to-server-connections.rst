Secure server-to-server connections
==============================================================

**Server-to-server connections are secure?** 

Nation state actors and other capable adversaries are proven to be able to tap Internet backbone connections and data centers.

The server-to-server connections should be encrypted in a manner such that anyone tapping physical cables cannot extract any information, like raw database traffic.

The connection encryption methods are VPN and SSH tunnels.
