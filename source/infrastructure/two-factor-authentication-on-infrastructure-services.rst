Two-factor authentication on infrastructure services
==============================================================

**Infrastructure services require two-factor authentication?** Yes / No


If infrastructure services provide a two-factor authentication, this option is used.

Internet services often rely on third-party services for infrastructure. The infrastructure services could include:

* Server hosting

* Domain name services

* Certificates

* Transactional email

* SMS

* Proxy and CDN services, etc.

Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security against cases in which passwords of team members get compromised. It also gives protection against social engineering and password reset attacks which the attacker may try against the infrastructure service accounts.
