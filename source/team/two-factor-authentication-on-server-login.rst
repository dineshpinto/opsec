Two-factor authentication on server login
==============================================================

**Terminal access to the server requires two-factor authentication?** Yes / No

Logging in to the server containing private data requires two-factor authentication.

Server login is further restricted with two-factor authentication, so that even in case the computer of a server administrator is hijacked by malware, this computer cannot log in to the server without user interaction and a two-factor token from a separate device. This makes it nearly impossible to hijack the secure connection to the server unnoticed.
