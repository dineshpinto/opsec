Minimized email usage
==============================================================

**Email is not used for internal communications?** 

Email as media is insecure. Email travels plain-text through the Internet. Even if the message content itself is encrypted, the metadata is still readable.

Instead of email, closed tools and services should be used for team internal communications.

For highly sensitive projects, the communication should be contained in an in-house server.
