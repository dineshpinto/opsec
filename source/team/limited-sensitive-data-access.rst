Limited sensitive data access
==============================================================

**Sensitive data access by administrators is limited?** Yes / No / Not applicable

Administrative access often implies the ability to view usersâ€™ private data.

When team members access private data, the access is limited in a way such that sensitive information is not exposed unless necessary for performing work. For example, social security numbers are not viewable among normal data unless the administrator chooses to explicitly show them.
