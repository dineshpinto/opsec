Password manager
==============================================================

**Team members use a password manager?** Yes / No

All team members use a password manager for their passwords. Randomization using a password manager is the only cognitively safe way to manage a lot of sensitive and strong passwords. Without randomized passwords, one compromised password may lead to the loss of other passwords due to password reuse or password pattern reuse.

Whether one can trust a third-party cloud-based service to store passwords is subject to discussion depending on the sensitivity of the project.
