Encrypted computers
==============================================================

**Work computers have disk encryption?** Yes / No

The permanent storage, SSD or hard disk on team membersâ€™ computers is fully encrypted.

All desktop operating systems have disk encryption technology available: FileVault (OSX), dm-crypt (Linux) or BitLocker (Windows). The usage of disk encryption implies password authentication upon computer power-on and wake-up so that powered-on devices cannot be accessed.

A lost device, when encrypted, cannot lead to any kind of compromise.



Applies for: Everyone
