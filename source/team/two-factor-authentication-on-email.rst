Two-factor authentication on email
==============================================================

**Team membersâ€™ work and personal email accounts require two-factor authentication to log in.?** Yes / No

Inboxes contain sensitive information. Often email acts as the key to third-party services and infrastructure, as email is used for logging in with a forgotten password option. Thus, getting into the inbox further compromises other services.

Email is an attractive target to hack, as email is either public or easily guessable. Even if the email account is protected by a strong password, flaws may exist in the password reset process, e.g., by intercepting the voice mail of the target user. Two-factor authentication provides additional protection against such attacks.
