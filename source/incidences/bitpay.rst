Bitpay, a popular Bitcoin payment gateway, lost 1.8M USD in phishing attack.

Bitpay's Chief Financial Office, Bryan Krohn, received an email from a business partner email address having a link pointing to a phishing site where Krohn proceeded to give out his email account credentials. The attacker logged into Khrohn's email and gained intel from the past conversations in the inbox.

Then the attacker send email to CEO Stephen Pair and executive chairman Tony Gallippi to authorize payments to "a customer wallet". There were four different payments, total of 5,000 BTC, 5,000 BTC, 3,000 BTC and 1,000 BTC. The CEO Pair confirmed from the Krohn via email whether the last payment was genuine. The attacker, still control of the Krohn's email accout, replied.

Apparently the C-level executives of Bitpay become aware of the attack because one of the real customers was CC'd in the email conversation and the customer contacted Bitpay that they had not asked for the payment.

Bitpay tried to get its insurer to cover $950,000 of the loss, but in June the insurer declined to pay. Bitpay is now suing the insurer.
