Apple iCloud
==============================================================

*Date: 2014-09-01*

Apple iCloud service was subject to login brute force attack leading to the compromise of several celebrity accounts.

Apple did not follow the security best practices to prevent brute forced login attempts. Find my iPhone, a part of iCloud services, allowed unthrottled login attempts.

Later the private photos of victims, most of them being celebrities, were leaked in Internet, causing harm to these people.

Apple did not apologize.
