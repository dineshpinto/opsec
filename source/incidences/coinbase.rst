Coinbase
==============================================================

*Date: 2014-04-01*

Coinbase has a Request money feature which sends email to a third party through Coinbase service.

Coinbase did not throttle this feature allowing anyone to send infinite number of emails through Coinbase.
Furthermore the feature exposed if any email had an account on Coinbase or not.

The security researcher reported the issue to Coinbase, who marked the issue as "WONTFIX" one month later. It was not until the publicly demostrated exploit when Coinbase took action.

Coinbase started to throttle the feature. Coinbase took a PR hit because the community did not find the initial response of Coinbase sufficient. The community questioned the security integrity of Coinbase as a whole.
