SMS intercepting trojans
==============================================================

*Date: 2015-09-01*






Multiple malware and trojan programs have been observed to intercept SMS two-factor authentication codes.

The trojans usually target banks and popular financial services. Malware is Android ecosystem issue. Though devices running other operating systems, especially jailbroken iOS, have been found infected.

When the user receives two-factor authentication codes over SMS the codes are forwarded to the attacker. The malware also does keylogging and intercepts logins and passwords of popular services.
