NASA lost a laptop containing data on 10,000 users.

Personally identifiable information of at least 10,000 NASA employees and contractors remained at risk of compromise.

The laptop did not have whole disk encryption, making it possible for the thief to access all the data.

The incident prompted an immediate agency-wide initiative to implement full disk encryption on all NASA laptops.
