Blockchain.info
==============================================================

*Date: 2015-06-01*

Blockchain.info, a popular Bitcoin wallet service, has been targeted through Google AdWords phishing advertisements multiple times over the years 2013-2015.

The attackers buy the top spot of the Google AdWords and make it point to the phishing. The end users cannot distinguish difference between the phishing ad and the legit search results when arriving to Google Search through the web browser search bar. The link in the advertisement can be genuine-like *www.blockchain.com.de/wallet/login* or totally bogus pointing to some random static site hosting service.

When the victim logs in to the phishing site, made to look like blockchain.info, the attackers steal the credentials and then proceed to move assets from the blockchain.info wallet.
