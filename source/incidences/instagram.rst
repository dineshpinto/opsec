*Date: 2014-12-08*

Instagram deleted millions of accounts.

Due to lax account creation process, A large proportion of Instagram accounts were fake and automatically created robot accounts. The fake accounts can be exploited as fake followers or to send spam. Social media PR companies may buy fake followers to inflate their campaign success rates.

It can be speculated that even if being aware of the severity of the issue Instagram was not in rush to delete the fake accounts before acquisition by Facebook to inflate their market value.

Some celebrities lost up to 90% of their followers. Instagram's own Instagram account lost 30% of its followers.
