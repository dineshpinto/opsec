Cryptoine
==============================================================

*Date: 2015-04-04*





Assets stolen: **1800 USD**


A race condition existed in the service of Cryptoine, now defunct Bitcoin exchange.

The race condition allowed the attacker to drain hot wallets of multiple cryptocurrencies of the service.

This damage caused the closure of the exchange. However the service was not popular, having only around 6 Bitcoins in their hot wallet.
