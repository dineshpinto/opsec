Code reviews
==============================================================

**Source code is reviewed?** Yes / No

The team uses code review, also known as code inspection, as the best practice when merging changes.

All code going to the production should be reviewed at least one person who is not the original author of the code. Two pairs of eyes see better than one to catch possible mistakes.



Applies for: Medium and large enterprises
