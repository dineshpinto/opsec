Web security
===========================================



Background
==========

Ultimately any Internet facing service must accept user input over the Internet. If the application is not written following the best practices, it's trivial to conduct an attack exploiting the application vulnerabilities.
This section does not discuss the web application vulnerabilities and mitigating them in detail. Instead, the team should use proper well-known secure framework in their application development, as usually the framework authors are well-versed in security matters and have thought out and documented the proper security matters.




.. _https-tls-only:

HTTPS / TLS only
==============================================================

**The service is HTTPS only?** Yes / No

The service offers traffic only over encrypted channels. Any sensitive service has no excuse not to to use full encryption anymore. It is well known that powerful actors tap and modify Internet traffic globally. Furthermore, the HTTP responses include security headers, like  HTTP Strict Transport Security and X-Frame-Option.

.. _a-framework-preventing-database-injection-attacks:

A framework preventing database injection attacks
==============================================================

**The software is written in a manner that there is no possibility of database injection attack?** Yes / No

One of the most common web application vulnerabilities is a database injection attack. In the most cases, the database is SQL based, providing opportunity for SQL injections. This can be easily prevented by never constructing database statements by hand and always using a framework to construct the queries, so that all values are properly escaped. The manual SQL manipulation should be prevented from the application developers, so that no room is left for a human error.

.. _a-framework-preventing-cross-site-scripting-attacks:

A framework preventing cross-site scripting attacks
==============================================================

**The software is written in a manner that there is no possibility of cross-site scripting attack?** Yes / No

Cross-site scripting attack is a way to perform actions on the behalf of the user when the user views or clicks a compromised payload. The attack target can be the site visitor or the site administrator. The usual cross-site scripting attack is posting text or file attachment which payload is not well-escaped HTML. This attack can be avoided by using a proper software development framework which always escapes variables in output and not relying the developers to manually escape variables in page templates, JavaScript or HTML JSON embeds.

.. _password-storage-best-practices:

Password storage best practices
==============================================================

**The user passwords and two-factor seed tokens are hashed using the state-of-the-art encryption?** Yes / No

This protects the user password integrity in the case the database is compromised. The developers should not do password management themselves, but use a proper framework or a library for it.

.. _non-public-administration-site:

Non-public administration site
==============================================================

**The administration site is not easily accessible to public?** Yes / No

Many common software platforms come with the default administration site in a location like */admin/*. If the administrative URLs are well-known the attacker can exploit this and guess weak administration interface HTTP endpoints to exploit those. The administration interface should be in non-guessable, non-end user visible, URL. Furthermore the additional access restrictions can be placed (see Team security chapter).
