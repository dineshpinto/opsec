Authorization and permission framework
==============================================================

**Private pages and data access is protected by authorization framework?** Yes / No

When protecting private data, a systematic authorization framework is used instead of ad-hoc conditions. A standardized permission check method leaves less room for human error in fragile permission check conditions.

In â€ he authorization framework approach:

* The same process is used in all permission checks.

* Manual conditions (ifs) are unnecessary to make permission checks, as the approach is prone to human error.

* All data is preferably private unless explicitly made public.

* The checks follow a standardized authorization pattern like an access control list or activity-based checks.
