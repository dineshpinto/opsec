Security incidence reference
==============================

This chapter contains references to historical security incidences, why they happened, the implications and what operational security measurements could have been taken to prevent them.

.. note ::

    The list was updated 2013-2015. It does not contain recent incidences. There has been
    only very few new attack vectors since then, so all best practices and malpractices
    found here stil apply.
