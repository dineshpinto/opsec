Security incidence reference
==============================

This chapter contains references to historical security incidences, why they happened, the implications and what operational security measurements could have been taken to prevent them.

.. attention ::

    *All Internet service incidences listed here could have been avoided by following the security practices presented in this guide.*

Some of the incidences are not directly related to a particular Internet service, e.g. SMS intercepting, but the case reflects the associated security risk it may pose to any Internet service and its user.
