  title: Protecting service users
  description:
    This chapter discusses protecting end users and guiding them to secure their accounts properly.

  background: |

    Even if team members maintain high security standards internally, malicious actors can go after the end users. For example, phishing operations target a group of users who are likely users of the service. If the end users give out their login credentials in the phishing attack, the attacker may damage these users even though the integrity of the service as a whole is not compromised.

    The service should take several measures to protect its users so that even if the attacker gains access to the user’s email inbox or password, the harm to the user is minimized.

questions:

  Two-factor authentication:
    answers: default
    applies: everyone
    question: Service users are encouraged to use two-factor authentication
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    rationale:  |
      Two-factor authentication, a.k.a. multifactor authentication, a.k.a. secure login, is a method to ask for a one-time token from the user when logging in. The primary purpose of two-factor authentication is to protect the user from password compromise.

      End users may lose their passwords through multiple threats like:

      * The user device is compromised by malware and the password is keylogged or extracted from the running password manager

      * The password is reused across multiple sites and one of the sites gets compromised. You can buy stock email and password lists on the black market.

      * The password is given out on a phishing site (see :ref:`trademark-protection`)

      * The password is extracted through a man-in-the-middle attack (see :ref:`https-tls-only`)

      Two-factor authentication stops the attacker, equipped with a mere password, from accessing the victim's account.

      Having two-factor authentication as an option is not enough. Users should be educated about two-factor authentication. Often users are not aware of threat models and the harm they may face because of lax security. Incentives, like reduced fees, should be applied to encourage the enabling of the two-factor authentication. From a business perspective, this can be justified as a reduced support cost of dealing with hacked account cases.

      Popular two-factor authentication methods include:

      * Mobile apps: Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP), Google Authenticator

      * Paper codes: One time pad, HOTP, popular with European banks

      * SMS and other phone-based methods

      * Hardware devices: YubiKey, others

      External services like Authy and Clef provide two-factor-as-a-service.

      Google Authenticator is a popular two-factor mobile app. Despite the fact that the name says Google, you can use it on your own site. The application can be used offline independently from Google services. Google Authenticator is based on RFC 6238. There are multiple open-source implementations for all desktop and mobile operating systems.

      .. note::

        SMS is not deemed secure in the large scale. SMS messages are intercepted by mobile malware. SMS may travel in plain text, and various parties in the operator business chain can read them. Mobile number portability opens a vector for the attacker to gain access to the victim’s phone number. SMS may not be reliable in third-world countries, thus making it not a viable option for global business.

  Third-factor authentication:
    question: The login process goes through an additional check in abnormal circumstances
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    rationale: |

      The login process should perform an additional check if there is a reason to believe that the login attempt might not be genuine.

      The users might not have two-factor authentication enabled. Even with two-factor authentication enabled, there is a chance that the user will give out the codes on a phishing site. In these cases, the service should detect abnormal conditions and perform additional checks before letting the login proceed.

      The common criteria triggering third-factor authentication include:

      * The country of the user’s IP address has changed.

      * The device or the web browser of the user has not been seen before, identified by a stored permacookie.

      In these cases, the service should prompt the login to go through additional verification steps. This could be:

      * Email confirmation

      * SMS confirmation

      .. note ::

        Third-factor authentication does not protect against cases in which the device of the user is compromised by malware and the service cannot differentiate between legit and malicious traffic coming from the same device.

  Re-authentication on sensitive actions:
    question: Sensitive actions should prompt for authentication again
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    answers: default
    rationale: |

      Security-sensitive actions should ask for an additional authentication attempt. Mere logging in to the service should not enable the attacker to perform sensitive actions.

      The additional authentication step can be:

      * Give the password again.

      * Email confirmation.

      * SMS confirmation.

      * Give another two-factor authentication token.

      Sensitive actions may include:

      * Making a withdrawal from the service.

      * Sending money to another user.

      * Changing password, email or phone number.

      * Closing the account.

      Asking for an additional authentication makes it difficult to automatize malicious actions, creating another layer of protection against phishing and XSS attacks.

      Sensitive operations, like those in which money is transferred out from the service, should require a minimum of two different two-factor authentication codes: one for login and one for transfer. This makes phishing site operations, which intercept two-factor authentication codes, less robust. Users are more likely to notice bad URLs the longer they need to spend time on the phishing site. The reuse of two-factor authentication codes allows the attacker to transfer out the assets if the victim logs into the phishing site even once.

  Brute force login prevention:
    question: Service login attempts are throttled in multiple ways
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    rationale: |

      Attackers may try to brute force the logins of users. The service should have adequate measures to prevent multiple login attempts and to effectively stop them.

      There are a few different brute force attack modes:

        * Spearhead a brute force attack against a single high-value victim.

        * Known email and known password combination list, leaked from a third-party site or bought from the black market.

        * Known email and common password list, guessing the 1000 most-common passwords.

      Attackers have been shown to possess thousands of IP addresses, so blocking individual IP addresses is not effective against a well-versed attacker.

      To prevent brute force attacks, counter actions should include:

        * Prevent multiple login attempts per user: require CAPTCA verification on second login attempt; allow only one wrong password attempt per user.

        * Prevent multiple login attempts from the same IP address or network.

        * Force all users to go through CAPTCHA before login if the system global login rate is abnormally high (botnet-based attack).

      Relying solely on CAPTCHA to prevent brute forcing is not recommended, as the automated CAPTCHA solving success rates are counted in the tens of percents. Thus, the malicious networks should be identified and dropped.

      Beside the security ramifications, a well-armed brute force logging attacker may cause denial of service, as the system is not able to handle all the login attempts.

      .. note::

        Forcing users to choose long passwords brings limited additional value. Passwords are effectively dead. It doesn't matter how complex the password is, as usually the whole password is lost due to phishing or keylogging malware. Instead, two-factor authentication should be encouraged as the primary option for increasing account security.

  Effective session kill:
    question: When the user account is deactivated or changed, the related sessions are dropped
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    rationale: |
      If the attacker gains access to a user account, system administrators must be able to kick out the attacker. In certain security-related actions, it is also good practice to drop the sessions of the user.

      Account deactivation, besides marking the user account deactivated in the database records, should also drop the active sessions which are usually stored in a separate backend like Memcached or Redis. When a user account is deactivated, all communication channels to this user must be dropped: HTTP sessions, WebSocket sessions, mobile application sessions and so on.

      Furthermore, all user sessions should be dropped when the users themselves perform changes which may affect account security. These include:

      * Password change

      * Email address change

      * Phone number change

      After the change has been performed, the user must relogin to the service. This allows the users themselves to act quickly in situations in which they notice that somebody has hacked into the account, e.g., via an incoming email notification. In this case, the user is still probably logged into the system with stolen credentials and the user may hurry to change the password to kick the attacker out.

  User audit logs:
    question: Service retains audit logs of sensitive user actions
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    rationale: |
      All sensitive actions should be logged to a user-specific action log.

      The users may or may not be able to view these log entries themselves. In the case of a user reporting a hacked account, the action log can be reviewed for swift judgement. In the case of a filed police report, due to an account hack, the user audit log can be handed to the officials.

      The user audit log also serves an important role in protecting the service operator itself against fraud. For example, a user can make a frivolous claim that the user’s account got hacked, then threaten to sue the service and publish the incident unless there is (incorrectly) reimbursement. In fact, the user might have just transferred out assets himself/herself to a friendly third party. The user audit logs prove the correct password and authentication codes were used to initiate the transfer and shift the responsibility to the user himself or herself.

      The user audit log should include at least:

      * User logins and login attempts

      * Password change and reset operations

      * Enabling and disabling two-factor authentication

      * Email change operations

      * All financial operations

      * Timestamp with timezone

      * IP address

      * User agent

  Account verification process:
    question: The creation of bogus accounts is prevented
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    answers: default_na
    rationale: |
      In services in which it is possible to spam or harass other users, fake accounts are a common problem.

      To keep the service clean, one should prevent the creation of fake and robot accounts. The cost of automated account creation should be high enough that there is no financial gain to create and use accounts for spamming. On the other hand, the account creation process should still be smooth enough that it doesn't discourage users from signing up.

      Account verification is also important for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) cases in which it is imperative to know that one is dealing with the rightful holder of the financial assets.

      Common account verification methods include:

      * CAPTCHA

      * Email verification

      * Phone verification

      * Browser verification by security proxy (CloudFlare, etc.)

      * IP reputation system (block countries where you have no business, block Tor and VPN IPs)

      * Piggybacking the authentication mechanism of a large service (Facebook, Twitter, Google OAuth)

      * Government ID verification services (available as-a-service like Jumio and Trulioo)

      Please note that all of these can be defeated if the financial incentive of the attacker is high enough.

  Flood action throttle:
    question: Actions sending messages to other users are throttled
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    answers: default
    rationale: |
      When the service provides ways to message or contact other users, these actions should be throttled so that one cannot flood messaging by sending a large number of useless messages.

      Example actions that should be throttled include:

      * Sending messages to other users

      * Sending invitation emails

      * Sending SMS messages

      If a malicious actor is free to send an infinite number of messages, this can be exploited for harassment. Even if the exploitation doesn't lead to direct financial gain for the attacker, the service may take a reputation hit and the brand suffers due to poor user experience.

      Throttling can be done by having time window thresholds for how many messages one user can send or how many messages can be sent on a global level. If the frequency of actions exceeds the limit of what a normal person would do, the action should be disabled or the user banned.

  Trademark protection:
    applies: sme
    question: Is the name of the service trademarked?
    spellchecked: 2015-10-10
    rationale: |
      A trademark helps protect against advertisement phishing.

      If you type the service name into Google or a web browser address search bar, Google displays advertisements on the top of the actual search results. These advertisement can be bought out to create misleading phishing links, like *www.blockchain.com.de/wallet/login*. Normal end users cannot distinguish between phishing advertisements and actual search results.

      If you have properly trademarked your service name, you can ask Google AdWords to not allow it to be used in advertisements, making advertisement phishing harder.

      Google AdWords is known to take down phishing advertisements quite slowly when reported.
