  title: Team security
  description:
    This chapter discusses how to guarantee the safety and integrity of team members, credentials, devices, tools and software.

  background: |

    Instead of trying to exploit the service directly, the adversaries may go after team members, managers and partners working on the project. The project should aim to protect team communications, devices and authorization keys so that they are unlikely to get compromised. This involves following basic IT security practices, cyberhygiene, key management and limiting the impact of potentially leaked data.

    The physical security, like door access keys or security cameras, is de-emphasized because these security aspects rarely reflect the reality of a mobile contemporary worker. Regardless of the broken physical security, the service should stay intact and uncompromised.

questions:

  Basic security practices:
    question: The team members follow the basic IT security practices
    rationale: |
      The team members are trained and aware of common cyber threads like phishing attacks and social engineering. They can identify basic attacks, like spearhead phishing emails, and do not fall victim to those.

      The team members maintain cyber hygiene and do not use work devices to visit sites which might compromise the web browser. Software, both desktop and server software, is maintained in up-to-date versions where know vulnerabilities do not exist.

  Dangerous file attachments:
    question: Potentially dangerous file attachments are handled securely
    rationale: |
      File attachments in email and chat are one of the most common attack vectors.

      The rigged files may include

      * Office files (Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, related)

      * Flash animations

      * PDF files

      The dangerous ommunication channels include anything where team members can be freely contacted. For example:

      * Email

      * Skype

      * WhatsApp

      The desktop applications and web browser plugins opening this kind of content should be disabled. If disabling is not an option then the attachments in email or outside team internal communication tool should be opened securely and never using the productivity applications themselves. The secure open methods includes opening the file in a web based viewer, web email preview or otherwise sandboxed tool. Furthermore a safe version of desktop productivity suite should be used which is preferably up-to-date open source tool.

  Password manager:
    question: The team members use password manager
    rationale: |
      All team members use a password manager for their passwords. Randomized passwords using a password manager is to only cognitively sane way to manage a lot of sensitive and strong passwords. Without randomized passwords, one compromised password may lead to loss of other passwords due to password reuse or password pattern reuse.

      Whether one can trust third party cloud-based service to store password is a subject to discussion depending on the sensitivity of the project.

  Third party devices:
    question: The team members do not use third party devices for logging in
    rationale: |
      If a device comes from an non-trusted party, it may contain keyloggers and other malware to record the user actions. Such devices include internet kiosks, school and library computers and other free terminals.

      The team members use only assigned devices for the work. Furthermore the devices should be sourced from a reputable vendor.

  Encrypted computers:
    question: The work computers have disk encryption
    rationale: |
      The permanent storage, SSD or hard disk, on the team member computers is fully encrypted.

      All desktop operating systems have disk encryption technology available: FileVault (OSX), dm-crypt (Linux) or BitLocker (Windows). The usage of disk encryption implies password authentication on computer power on and wake up, so that powered on devices cannot be accessed.

      A lost device, when encrypted, cannot lead to any kind of compromise.

  Encrypted mobile devices:
    question: The team members have disk encryption on their phones and tablets
    rationale: |

      A lost device, when encrypted, cannot lead to any kind of compromises. Even if the device were not to contain sensitive data per se it could contain active email inboxes and team chats leading to further account compromise and phishing.

      The device should be protected by password and not easily guessable pattern or easily foolable fingerprint scanner.

      .. note ::

        Having any kind of online recovery option for a forgotten device password is deemed unsafe. In the case of a forgotten password the device should be wiped and factory reseted.

      .. note ::

        Remote wiping tools give almost zero protection in the case of a lost device. It's trivial to take a mobile device offline and extract data from a powered down device.

  Minimized email usage:
    question: Email is not used for internal communications
    rationale: |
      Email as media is insecure. Email travels plain-text through Internet. Even if the message content itself is encrypted the metadata is still readable.

      Instead of email, closed tools and services should be used for team internal communications.

      For highly sensitive projects the communication should be contained in an in-house server.

  Two-factor authentication on email:
    question: The team member work and personal email accounts require two-factor authentication to log in
    rationale: |
      Inboxes contain sensitive information. Often email acts as the key to third party services and infrastructure, as email is used for logging with a forgotten password option. Thus, getting into the inbox further compromises other services.

      Email is an attractive target to hack in as email is either public or easily guessable. Even if the email account is protected by strong password, flaws may exist in the password reset process, e.g. by intercepting the voice mail of the target user. Two-factor authentication provides additional protection against such attacks.

  Two-factor authentication on critical services:
    question: Infrastructure services requires two-factor authentication
    rationale: |
      If infrastructure services provide a two-factor authentication this option is used.

      Internet services often rely on third party services for infrastructure. The infrastructure services could include

      * Server hosting

      * Domain name services

      * Certificates

      * Transactional email

      * SMS

      * Proxy and CDN services, etc.

      Two-factor authentication provides additional layer of security against cases where the passwords of the team members get compromised. It also gives protection against social engineering and password reset attacks which the attacker may try against the infrastructure service accounts.

  Two-factor authentication for admins:
    question: The website administrators use two-factor authentication
    rationale: |
      The team members, support personel and other people with the administrative access to the website use two-factor authentication.

      Internet services often provide an administrative site or access where the site managers perform in-house updates, edits and other support tasks. This kind of administrative access should be available only through two-factor authentication.

      If the attacker compromises a password of a team member they should not be able to get in to the administrative site. Furthermore the administrative access can be limited to VPN or other well-known (office) IPs.

  Passphrase on server login keys:
    question: The terminal access to the server requires passphrase protected key
    rationale: |
      Logging to the server containing private data is only allowed with the passphrase protected key files.

      The usual logging method is by SSH secure shell connection, but if alternative methods to access the server exist the key files should be used there too.

      Using key files instead of passwords protects against brute force attacks, simple keylogging attacks, weak password attacks and such. Furthermore the keys must be passphrase protected so in the the case a key file itself leaks it is useless for the attacker.

      .. note ::

        If the hosting provider has console, terminal or root password reset option on the server a special attention should be paid on this. It is better either to disable this feature or make sure it is behind two-factor authentication and cannot be performed by the hosting provider personel.

  Two-factor authentication on server login:
    question: The terminal access to the server requires two-factor authentication
    rationale: |
      Logging to the server containing private data requires two-factor authentication.

      The server login is further restricted with two-factor authentication, so that even in the case the computer of a server administrator is hijacked by malware, this computer cannot login to the server without user interaction and two-factor token from a separate device. This makes it near impossible to hijack the secure connection to the server unnoticed.

  Audited server login keys:
    question: A real-time method of maintaining and revoking keys across all servers
    rationale: |
      In any point of time, the administrators of the project can revoke any key used by the team. Full audit logs of key provision and usage is available and stored separately.

      This allows quickly address the issues when a compromise is suspected.

  Software installation from safe sources:
    question: Software is installed from known good sources
    rationale: |
      Pirated software is riddled with malware. The team members installs software coming from legit sources only, reducing the risk the software comes with malware.


      The safe software channels include

      * App stores by operating system vendors

      * Official, signed, UNIX distribution repositories

      * Programming community package repositories

      Basic security understanding and cyberhygiene should be still applied when installing from the safe channels. E.g. Google Play is known to host several rigged applications.

      Even if the malware is not targetting the project itself, the malware authors inspect the infected computers for high value targets and may open an attack if they notice such a successful infection.

  Limited sensitive data access:
    question: Sensitive data access by administrators is limited
    rationale: |
      Administrative access often implies being able to view user private data.

      When the team members access private data, the access is limited in a way that the sensitive information is not exposed unless necessary for performing the work. For example, social security numbers are not viewable among normal data, unless the administrator chooses to explicitly show it.

  Logged sensitive data access:
    question: Sensitive data access by administrators is logged
    rationale: |
      All actions on administrators accessing and manipulating sensitive data are logged.

      In the case of privacy breach claims these logs can be used to reconstruct the scenario who have been accessing or manipulating the data.

      This can be implementd e.g. by storing the full HTTP access logs, including POST parameters, from all logged in administrators.

  Data scrubbing:
    question: Data dumps are cleaned from sensitive information
    rationale: |
      Instead of working with full production datasets, there exist a repeatable process of making a cleaned dataset with sensitive information removed from the data.

      The data scrubbing process e.g. can reset

      * User email addresses

      * Phone numbers, physical addresses and social security number

      * Password hashes

      * Two-factor tokens

      The cleaned dataset is then given to the team members who need to analyse, test and develop against the data.

      The cleaning process limits the impact of potential data leak in the cases where the data dump accidentally ends up to the third party. Furthermore the cleaned data ensures that messages from the testing environment cannot reach the actual users.
