  title: Team security
  description: Ensure integrity of team personal accounts and development tools.

  background:

    The physical security, like door access keys or security cameras, is de-emphasized because these aspects might no longer reflect the reality of a mobile worker.

  threats:
    - Loss of data
    - Loss of devices
    - Loss of passwords
    - Malware
    - Watering hole attack
    - Physical attacks

questions:
  Password manager:
    question: The team members use password manager
    rationale: All team members use password manager for all of their the passwords. The password manager is the only rational way to manager sensitive, strong and random passwords. If no password manager is used the cognitive load for maintaining secure passwords is too high. Without randomized passwords, a compromised third party site may lead to loss of other passwords due to password or password pattern reuse.
    answer: default
    applies: everyone
    categories: password, authentication

  Third party devices:
    question: The team members do not use third party devices for logging in
    rationale: If the device comes from an untrusted party, it may contain keyloggers and other malware to record the user actions. Such devices include internet kiosks and other free terminals.
    answer: default
    applies: everyone

  Encrypted computers:
    question: The team members have disk encryption enabled on their personal computers
    rationale: The disk encryption implies password login to the computer wake up. A lost device, when encrypted, cannot lead to any kind of compromises
    answers: default
    applies: everyone
    categories: encryption

  Encrypted mobile devices:
    question: The team members have disk encryption enabled on their mobiles and tablets. The devices are password protected
    rationale: A lost device, when encrypted, cannot lead to any kind of compromises. Even if the device were not to contain sensitive data it may contain an accessible email session which can be used to further account compromise and phishing.
    answers: default
    applies: everyone
    categories: encryption

  Two-factor authentication on email:
    question: The team member email accounts require two-factor authentication to log in
    rationale: Email accounts contain sensitive information and they can be used to reset the master password of services and infrastructure. Email account is also attractive target to hack in as it is public. Even if email account is protected by strong password, various flaws may exist in the password reset process, e.g. by intercepting the voice mail of the target user. Two-factor authentication provides additional protection against such attacks.

    categories: password, authentication

  Two-factor authentication on critical services:
    question: Administrating infrastructure services requires two-factor authentication
    rationale: "The team relies on third party services for infrastructure: hosting, domain name, certificates, email, SMS, attack mitigation proxies, etc. If these services provide a two-factor authentication this option is used. This adds additional layer of security if the infrastructure provider becomes a target of attack and the master password can be reset e.g. through phishing."

    applies: everyone

  Server login keys are passphrase protected:
    question: The server logging in is by keys only which are passphrase protected
    rationale: The logging in to production or staging servers is only allowed with the key files. The key files are passphrase protected. The usual logging method is by SSH, but if alternative methods exist accessing the servers they must provide similar method. This protects against brute force attacks against devop access. Furthermore keys must be passphrase protected so in the the case keys are accidentally leaked they are not useful.
    answers: default
    applies: everyone

  Server login requires two-factor authentication:
    question: The server logging in requires one time token
    rationale: The server login is further restricted to two-factor authentication, so that even in the case the devop laptop is hijacked by malware, this laptop cannot login to the server without a token from an external device.

  Server login keys are audited:
    question: A real-time method of maintaining and revoking keys across all servers is used
    rationale: In any point of time, the system administrators of the company can revoke any key in the whole organization. Full audit logs of key usage is available and stored separately. This allows quickly to address issues when a key compromise is suspected.

  Software comes from secure sources:
    question: Software installation comes from knonw good sources
    rationale: Pirated software is riddled with malware. The team installs software which comes from legit sources only, reducing the risk the software comes with maware.
    answer: default
    applies: everyone

  Backend sensitive data access is limited:
    question: Backend sensitive data access is limited
    rationale: If multiple people access the backend data, the access is limited in a way that the sensitive information is not exposed unless necessary for performing the work.
    answer: default
    applies: everyone

  Data scrubbing is used:
    question: When working with datasets, it is cleaned from sensitive information
    rationale: Instead of working with full datasets, there exist a documented process of making a cleaned dataset with reduced sensitive information. This cleaned dataset is given for team members who need to analyse, test and develop against the data. This also limits the impact of data dump leak in the case the data dump ends up to the hands of a third party.
